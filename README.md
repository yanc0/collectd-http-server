[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yanc0/greedee.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yanc0/greedee)

## How it work?

Greedee is a fast HTTP Gateway for collectd's 
`write_http` plugin. It is very modular and can be very easily
enhanced.

It supports:

* Basic Auth
* Graphite Backend
* Console Backend (debug)

## Install

* Download latest release on [release page]("https://github.com/yanc0/collectd-http-server/releases")
* Move it on `/usr/bin/greedee`
* Configure it on `/etc/greedee/config.toml` [example here](config.toml)
* Run it by executing the greedee binary
* Install collectd (tested on 5.7.1 but should work with not 
too old previous version).
* Load and configure plugin `write_http` in JSON
Output [Official docs here](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Write_HTTP#JSON_Example)
